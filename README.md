## In Progress

I'm rewriting the prototype using SvelteKit. The full application will have the same features as the prototype.
<br>
The app is wrapped with SvelteKit in [v0.2.0](https://github.com/demetriuszhomir/ImageBatchDownloader/releases/tag/v0.2.0). But it's not broken down into modules.

I share my progress on my [X profile](https://x.com/DemetriusZhomir) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DemetriusZhomir). Follow me there for updates!
